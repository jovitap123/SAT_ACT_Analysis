# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

## Problem Statement

The SAT test is a college admission exam which is now being mandated nationwide across the United States. The ACT test is a direct competitor of the SAT and has also been used extensively. This project compares exam scores and participation rates for both ACT and SAT for the years 2017 and 2018.Recommendations are also provided to boost SAT participation rates nation wide particularly in states with low participation rates like Oklahoma.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The SAT test is gaining popularity among many states across USA. However, the ACT still poses strong competition having 100% participation rates in many states. States like Oklahoma have consistant low SAT participaion rates for both 2017 and 2018.Some recommendations to boost participation rates would be: Working with state school boards to reduce or eliminate fees, preliminary testing and tutoring focus on SAT test taking and focus efforts on improving  test access to minory communities.Additional data from each state based on demographics would help develop state specific participation improvement plans.
